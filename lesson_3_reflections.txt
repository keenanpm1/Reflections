When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working on a single computer by yourself it makes sense to keep all the work local.  When working with a group a remote repository facilitates this.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

When working in a group you may not want other peoples changes to interfere with your work untill you are ready.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a copy of a repository on GitHub that gives credit to the original creator.  A clone is a copy of a repository, local or on GitHub, that does not necessarily give credit to the original.  A branch is a version of the repository that is tracked along side the main or master branch for development or other logical purposes.  A branch can exist on both GitHub and locally.

Commands:

git clone **html/path**     Clone a git repository.  Make a copy
git remote -v     Print the path names for the push and pull locations
git push origin master     Push changes made locally to the GitHub
